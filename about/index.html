  <h2>The site</h2>
  <p>This is a simple website that allows me to publish things that I have worked on, in the form of project pages and block posts about said projects. That being said, this website is going to act as a journal of sorts that will guide others through the various rabbit holes I fall into -- possibly stumbling into others in the process. Results may vary.</p>

  <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a software developer that loves exploring all facets of technology. I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at George Washington University. I also am a certified scuba diver and can make fart noises with my hands! However, I cannot do both at the same time. If I miraculously perfect this feat, I will be sure to update you. My partner in crime is my cat, Blossom, who may work her way into various parts of the site.
